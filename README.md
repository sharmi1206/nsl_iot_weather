Neural Network Structured Learning on Iot Datasets

Neural Structured Learning (Adversarial) with TensorFlow

Dataset collected from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+

neural_structured_learning_iot.py shows training classification model with Adversarial Regularization

without_nsl_learning_iot.py shows training classification model without Adversarial Regularization

The results folder contains summary from each one of them and depicts how Training with Adversarial Regularization can increase the model aaccuracy and its robustness.
